Sending Data to Telegram: Bypassing Filtering Restrictions

There are various methods for sending data to Telegram. However, in countries like Iran, Telegram is filtered, and users need to enable a VPN to send data. Fortunately, there are numerous ways to circumvent these data transmission restrictions, such as using HTTP debuggers. These methods allow you to bypass filtering and receive data without the need for a VPN.

Create a Glitch Project:

Replace Project Files with GitHub Repository Content

After creating the "Hello Node" project, follow these steps to replace the contents of the package.json and server.js files with the content from the provided GitHub repository:

Delete Existing Files:

Open your Glitch project's editor.
Delete the existing package.json and server.js files.

After applying the changes and embedding the codes, simply click on "Preview in a new window" to see your server address. (You may have to wait a bit for it to start up)

For example, my server address is:
https://su*i*ing-inc*c*e-dr**ser.glitch.me/

This is just an example.

Alright. The server is ready... Now we can simply write a piece of Python code in the following style and apply the changes:

Change the numeric ID, bot token, and server address, and then run the Python code...

And just like that, we have bypassed Telegram filtering in Iran... Of course, more convenient methods like using a VPS require payment... But this is Iran, and we, the people of Iran, are forced to circumvent the limitations... Goodbye!
